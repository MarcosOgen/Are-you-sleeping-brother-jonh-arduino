This is the are you sleeping brother jonh melody for arduino.
It uses the Tone.h library (https://github.com/daniel-centore/arduino-tone-library) to produce a square wave of a certain frequenty.
you have to connect your speaker to pin 8 and ground (gnd).

I hope you enjoy the music and a shout-out to the creators of the Tone.h library.
